# jetplotter

Tool to manipulate and plot data from histograms. It uses parts of HarryPlotter,
but is less powerful though the code structure is much simpler and nicer.

## Description

### Parser

### Structure

### Plotting

## TODO
  - make modules robust vs. relative imports (maybe it is not even possible)
  - rename id (shadows builtin)
  - keep order of legend entries (difficult due to dict, probably another setting with list of ids)
  X Callback Handler
  - move output stuff to core.
  - do not store provided_args in config
