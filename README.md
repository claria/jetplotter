# plotting

## TODO
  - make modules robust vs. relative imports (maybe it is not even possible
  - rename id (shadows builtin)
  - keep order of legend entries (difficult due to dict, probably another setting with list of ids)
  - Check for labelled handlers before adding legend
  - Correctly distinguis between facecolor and edgecolor
